STARR reflections

## Contribution towards the project

### Situation
A group of seven students were placed in a project group for the ortho-eyes project during the minor data science. Our 
goal was to diagnose shoulder disabilities using movement data from several sensors connected to each other, called the 
flock of birds system.

### Task
One of the tasks was to create a data manager. This code was, to simply put it, generate the data which can be fed 
to the machine learning model, after all our data enrichment techniques were applied. I took this task upon myself 
and started working on it right away

### Action
One of the issues I encountered after I finished the task was how hard it was to explain to most of my peers. I 
understood what it did and how it operated, but even with the comments and verbal explanation it wasn't clear. 
To make matters worse, because most of them couldn't understand the code a mistake I made wasn't picked up upon 
until later. The mistake involved not picking enough data samples from the data file, despite it being specified 
in the configuration.

### Result
The first run of all our generated configurations wasn't until the day before the holidays. This was when we 
picked up upon the mistake in the code. My peers were understandably upset, and I of course took all the blame 
upon myself to not escalate the situation. In the end a well functioning data manager was delivered, albeit 
the mistakes and hardship.

### Reflection
I was pretty upset with myself. Not being able to explain what I did was already pretty bad, yet they trusted 
I did the right thing. When we picked up on the mistake I sort of started questioning if I was actually 
competent enough to do this. I talked with the group and asked them to let me try again over the holidays 
to create a manager which is understandable for everyone and functions as expected. They agreed and I went to 
work. From there on out I made a mental note for myself to run down my code again and see if it's actually 
comprehensible. If there are parts which aren't completely clear I should make sure I can clear them up 
without hesitation, to avert confusion. I also started writing test cases beforehand to make sure the system 
behaves in the expected way, and not in a way which was more convenient to code.


## Learning objectives

### Situation
A group of seven students were placed in a project group for the ortho-eyes project during the minor data science. Our 
goal was to diagnose shoulder disabilities using movement data from several sensors connected to each other, called the 
flock of birds system.

### Task
The goal of this minor is to learn techniques which can be used in data science applications, like a workplace. To 
build a foundation there are lectures every monday, and a multiple choice test at the end of the semester.

### Action
Since I had very little knowledge about this subject before this minor, I decided to enroll. I wanted to learn more 
about something I had no previous experience with. My learning objectives were to get more insight on what working 
in this field would look like. Besides that I wanted to learn about data classification, how does a computer learn 
to differentiate data.

### Result
I studied for the test and attended almost all lectures. Besides that I looked into other data science techniques 
besides what the curriculum offered. I managed to pass the multiple choice test, like most students. The results of 
the test were less flattering however, I only managed to score a mere 6.2.

### Reflection
Despite my efforts to gain a better understanding of data science I feel like I failed somewhat. Yes I passed the 
test, and was to use within the project group. Yet I feel like I didn't learn enough this past semester. I know 
this minor, and classes in general, are to lay a foundation one can build upon when he/she goes to work in said 
field. Thus I can conclude I didn't study enough myself, which would also explain my average mark for the multiple 
choice test.

I did manage to accomplish both of my learning objectives, and am quite happy with that. I think if I ever go 
into data science (which isn't really my cup of tea as it turns out) I can at least do the basic things, and 
build further upon the foundation built up during this minor. 

Data classification turns out to be not that difficult to setup, assuming the right libraries are used. The math 
behind these clever algorithms goes way above my head. I do want to somewhat understand the more basic ones like 
logistic regression. Therefor might spend some time in the foreseeable future really understand what goes on 
behind those few lines of code.


## Group evaluation

### Situation
A group of seven students were placed in a project group for the ortho-eyes project during the minor data science. Our 
goal was to diagnose shoulder disabilities using movement data from several sensors connected to each other, called the 
flock of birds system. The group consisted of students from different backgrounds, two of them were from different 
universities within the Netherlands, and another two of them were from abroad - Germany and France.

### Task
Together we had to create a most optimal classification for people with shoulder diseases. This is done in 
collaboration with the LUMC. The data and insights in how the system works is provided by them. The data 
we received was grouped by patient group with patients within them. The patients have mostly performed the
same exercises. Furthermore the data set is labeled quite well.

### Action
Together we worked on creating the best classification possible with our knowledge. The first thing we did was 
verify and reproduce the results achieved by the project group of last year. During this period we also went to 
the LUMC to get some things cleared up about our data set. While we were there we also created our own recordings. 
Thereafter we cleaned the data set, and created several data enrichment techniques.

### Result
In the end we ran all our generated configurations twice, this was due to a mistake on my end. Besides that we had 
to exclude one patient group - patient group 4. It seemed that the data samples were not as coherent compared to 
the other patient groups. Contacting the LUMC about this issue has been done, however no response was received in 
time to process this before the deadline. The results were quite good the second time around, and we're overall 
pleased with what's achieved.

### Reflection
In retrospective I'm happily surprised working with international students was pretty much hassle free, and I'd 
definitely want do it again. Communication and using the right words really is key in working with them. It can 
already be somewhat difficult understanding each others standpoint in a native language, let alone a foreign one.

Overall I'd say we're quite happy with the work we've delivered and pleased to see these results. They however are 
kind of underwhelming compared to the project group from last year. Nevertheless we've delivered a product with 
little to no assumptions in contradict to last year. I feel like this is what really sets it apart. It's a solid 
product which can be further build upon by a next group.
